# AirWeather

introduce

This semester we made a weather forecast software. This software is MVC architecture. We use realtime database in firebase as database.

When we launch the homepage, the software gets your location and loads the local weather.
We use two APIs for this functionality. One is the positioning API, called Gaode Map, which is a Chinese map software similar to Google Maps.
The other is the weather API, called HeFeng Weather, which is also a Chinese weather software.

I use the map API to get the location and get the city name. Then send the city name to the weather API, and the weather API will obtain the city ID according to the city name, and obtain the weather information through the city ID. This process is clearly implemented in my code.

Idea

We love to travel, before every trip I make travel plans, and most importantly, I look at the weather at the travel location. This is very important because the weather largely determines our travel experience. So we want to develop a weather forecast app so that we can check the weather of the travel destination before every trip. The app will also have a location feature, because we love hiking and itâ€™s easy to get lost in nature, so location is also very important.
