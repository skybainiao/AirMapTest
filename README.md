# AirWeather

Idea

We love to travel, before every trip I make travel plans, and most importantly, I look at the weather at the travel location. This is very important because the weather largely determines our travel experience. So we want to develop a weather forecast app so that we can check the weather of the travel destination before every trip. The app will also have a location feature, because we love hiking and itâ€™s easy to get lost in nature, so location is also very important.
